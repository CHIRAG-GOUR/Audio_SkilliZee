<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>How fun would it be if you could dress up your sprite just like yourself?</p>

<p>In <strong>Scratch</strong>, that is possible using a sprite costume! In this article, we’ll guide you in adding different accessories to make your sprite look better and fun!</p>

<h2>Scratch Programming</h2>

<p>Scratch is a visual programming language and an online community developed by the MIT Media Lab. It is designed to teach coding concepts to beginners, especially kids, in a fun and interactive way.</p>

<p>Scratch provides a graphical interface where users can drag and drop code blocks to create animations, games, stories, and interactive projects. If you are new to scratch programming, then we recommend you read the A to Z Guide on Block Coding.</p>

<h2>What are Sprite Costumes in Scratch programming?</h2>

<p>As you can guess, a <strong>sprite costume</strong> refers to your sprite’s appearance or visual features. Each sprite can have multiple costumes, which allow it to change its appearance dynamically during the program’s execution.</p>

<p>Why do you think <strong>costumes</strong> would be used in Scratch? Well, it is used for creating animations, character movements, and visual effects in Scratch projects.</p>

<img class="article-image" src="https://www.codingal.com/resources/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1-8.png" alt="Sprite costumes example 1">

<img class="article-image" src="https://www.codingal.com/resources/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2-4.png" alt="Sprite costumes example 2">

<p>These costumes can be named, created, edited, deleted, and changed – so many options! The best part is that each and every sprite must have at least one costume. Each sprite has a default costume.</p>

<h2>How to Make a Sprite Costume in Scratch?</h2>

<p>Here’s how you can customize your Sprite to look pretty and fun:</p>

<h3>Create a Costume</h3>

<p>There are two ways of getting a costume or background for a sprite or stage. (Yes, you can even customize the background of your Scratch Project!)</p>

<ol>
    <li>Drawing one using the inbuilt Scratch built-in editor by selecting your sprite and clicking the “paint” button.<br>
        <img class="article-image" src="https://www.codingal.com/resources/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3-3.png" alt="Paint new costume button">
    </li>
    <li>Getting an image or multiple images from your computer, either by clicking the “import” button as shown or dragging in an image from an open folder.<br>
        <img class="article-image" src="https://www.codingal.com/resources/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/4-4.png" alt="Import costume button">
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>Edit a Costume</h3>

<p>There are two different categories of costumes: <strong>Vector</strong> and <strong>Bitmap</strong>. Bitmap costumes are made from small dots called pixels. On the other hand, Vector costumes are made up of straight lines.</p>

<div class="center">
    <img class="article-image" src="https://www.codingal.com/resources/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/5-4.png" alt="Bitmap vs Vector comparison">
</div>

<p>Now, Scratch offers similar editing options for both types of costumes with only minor differences. You’ll find more about it as you read ahead.</p>

<img class="article-image" src="https://www.codingal.com/resources/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/6-3.png" alt="Bitmap and Vector mode switch">

<h3>Editing in Bitmap</h3>

<ol>
    <li>The <strong>brush</strong>. The brush is used to make general shapes, and it is the most common costume-making tool.<br>
        <img class="article-image" src="https://www.codingal.com/resources/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/7-4.png" alt="Brush tool">
    </li>
    <li>The <strong>line</strong>. The line is for creating straight edges that are hard to create with the brush.<br>
        <img class="article-image" src="https://www.codingal.com/resources/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/8-2.png" alt="Line tool">
    </li>
    <li>The <strong>rectangle tool</strong> (or press and hold shift to draw a square). With this, you can draw a perfect box without much hassle.<br>
        <img class="article-image" src="https://www.codingal.com/resources/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/9-2.png" alt="Rectangle tool">
    </li>
    <li>The <strong>circle tool</strong> (Press and hold shift to draw a circle). This tool creates a better circle or oval than the brush tool if you want a good circle.<br>
        <img class="article-image" src="https://www.codingal.com/resources/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/10-2.png" alt="Circle tool">
    </li>
    <li>The <strong>text</strong>. Click on the place you want to type, and a text box will pop up. This may be used for labelling or custom texts.<br>
        <img class="article-image" src="https://www.codingal.com/resources/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/11-2.png" alt="Text tool">
    </li>
    <li>The ‘<strong>fill with colour</strong>’ tool. Click anywhere to fill that space with any colour of your choice.<br>
        <img class="article-image" src="https://www.codingal.com/resources/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/12-2.png" alt="Fill with colour tool">
    </li>
    <li>The <strong>eraser</strong>. You know what an eraser does! It eliminates the colour or whatever customization you have applied!<br>
        <img class="article-image" src="https://www.codingal.com/resources/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/13-2.png" alt="Eraser tool">
    </li>
    <li>The ‘<strong>select</strong>’ tool. You use it to move the selected space to a new position.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Editing in Vector</h3>

<p>There are 9 editing options in the vector category, but only 2 of them are different from the bitmap category mentioned above. Let’s dive into the different functionality:</p>

<ol>
    <li>The <strong>reshape</strong> tool. After selecting an item, dots will appear around the shape in different places. You can move the dots around to create custom shapes, like a triangle from a square. How cool is that?<br>
        <img class="article-image" src="https://www.codingal.com/resources/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/13-2.png" alt="Reshape tool example">
    </li>
    <li>The <strong>select</strong> tool. It has the same function as discussed above. The only difference is when you select an object, two smart tools pop up: “Send back one layer” and the “Send forward one layer” tools.</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, if your sprite is wearing a shirt and a jacket, then the shirt will be behind the jacket, so we can use the “Send back” option on the shirt.</p>

<h3>Costume-Related Blocks</h3>

<p>Do you want your sprite to change costumes mid-game, or support add-on customization? You can do all that via these code blocks:</p>

<div class="center">
    <img class="article-image" src="https://www.codingal.com/resources/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/14-1.png" alt="Costume related Scratch blocks">
</div>

<p>Based on the same colour of the first three blocks, you can tell they belong in the same “Looks” block section. On the other hand, the last block can be found in the “Sensing” block area.</p>

<p>Let’s explain the purpose of each of these blocks:</p>

<ol>
    <li>The first block is used to switch the costumes of the sprite after some specific action.</li>
    <li>The second block is used to trigger the next costume, if any.</li>
    <li>The third block contains the number of the current costume of a sprite. You can select a particular costume for your sprite based on a specific condition.</li>
    <li>The fourth block allows for any sprite’s dimensions, costume amount, volume, and size to be read.</li>
</ol>
